# Dicee Game

## How the Dicee Game Works

1. **Start the Game**:
   - When you open the page, you’ll see a simple interface with two sections: one for **Player 1** and one for **Player 2**. Each section will display an empty dice image.

2. **Rolling the Dice**:
   - The game generates random dice rolls for both players. This is done by selecting a random number between 1 and 6 (simulating the roll of a dice). Each player’s dice image is updated with the corresponding random number.
   - The images of the dice (e.g., `dice1.png`, `dice2.png`, etc.) are displayed for both players.

3. **Determining the Winner**:
   - After both dice rolls are displayed, the game compares the two rolls:
     - If **Player 1’s** dice shows a higher number, **Player 1 wins**.
     - If **Player 2’s** dice shows a higher number, **Player 2 wins**.
     - If both players roll the same number, it results in a **draw**.

4. **Displaying the Result**:
   - The result (e.g., "Player 1 Wins!", "Player 2 Wins", or "It's a draw!") is shown at the top of the screen in a large, bold font.

5. **Refreshing the Game**:
   - Each time you refresh the page (e.g., by pressing F5 or clicking the refresh button in your browser), the dice are re-rolled, and a new result is displayed.
